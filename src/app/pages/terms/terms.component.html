        <p>Below is a list of some of the important things we do and don’t do.</p>
        <h3>WARNING AND NOTICE</h3>
        <p>Swifte is an open platform with unrestricted access. Swifte sometimes ask drivers to add their license number and insurance company name before adding a ride in the app only to discourage users without valid insurance and license information to post rides. HOWEVER, neither Swifte nor our Trusted Partners (including without limitation public and private employers, educational and other local public agencies, authorized contractors and private business entities who facilitate or promote Swifte services) have conducted background investigation or review of any kind or type, including without limitation driver’s license checks, insurance checks, criminal records checks, sex offender status, or otherwise. If you decide to participate, you assume all risks for using this platform and/or participating in the Swifte program. </p>
        <h3>HOLD HARMLESS</h3>
        <p>	As a voluntary user of the Swifte Software, you agree that neither Swifte nor Swifte ’s Trusted Partners (including without limitation public and private employers, educational and other local public agencies, authorized contractors and private business entities who facilitate or promote Swifte services), nor any of their respective employees, contractors, members, agents and officers shall be liable or responsible in any way for any personal injury, loss or other harm to you or your property resulting from my participation in the Swifte  program and you further agree to release, discharge, hold harmless, and forever acquit this website’s and application’s sponsors, Swifte  or Trusted Partners (including without limitation public and private employers, educational and other local public agencies, authorized contractors and private business entities who facilitate or promote Swifte  services) from any and all actions, causes of action, claims or any liabilities whatsoever, known or unknown, now existing or which may arise in the future, on account of or in any way related to or arising out of my participation in the programs.</p>
        <p>I acknowledge that participation in Swifte, a carpool, vanpool, or any Emergency Ride Home Program is an individual decision and that I am responsible for my operation of, or participation in Swifte.

        <h3>SECURITY</h3>
        <p>Swifte, program sponsors and Trusted Partners cannot, and do not, assess the suitability of Participants or other Swifte users to engage in ride sharing.

Background or other checks are not normally performed; even where background, MVR or other checks have been performed, we cannot guarantee that the results of those checks are accurate or up to date. As a Participant, you are solely responsible for selecting the individuals and/or entities with whom you travel and you do so entirely at your own risk. If you do not feel comfortable sharing a ride for any reason, you should and are responsible for using another means of transportation.</p>

        <h3>REPORTING EARNINGS FROM Swifte </h3>
        <p>All drivers are considered users of the Swifte platform, monies earned using Swifte are in fact motoring costs reimbursed at the Federal approved motoring rate of $0.565 cents per mile, therefore you are not required to report on this in your tax submissions. If you are in doubt please contact an Independent Tax Advisor.</p>
        <h3>Legal ridesharing</h3>
        <p>	Swifte is protected by USA Public Law 112-141 (MAP 21 Section 1501) passed in 2012, which defines qualified "real-time ridesharing" programs. The IRS sets the allowable limit for deductible mileage, if used for business or commuting purposes, and that amount is currently $0.56 per mile (currently IRS has no separate cost factor for electric vehicles). Swifte mileage rates are fixed for all riders and drivers, and tiers down from $0.20 as a method to equitably share the cost of a journey, assuming 2-3 persons per car. All Swifte pilots are funding by the Federal Highway Administration, and include participation from the State level Department of Transportation, and the County level Transportation Authority. The purpose of the rider fee is NOT for the driver to make a profit, but rather to automate the human behavior of "chipping in" for gas at the end of the week, or month, between carpool buddies. Finally, any driver can provide a FREE trip to any rider.</p>
        <p><strong>Reference - SEC. 1501. REAL-TIME RIDESHARING</strong>
        Paragraph (3) of section 101(a) of title 23, United States Code (as redesigned by section 1103(a)(2)), is amended by striking ‘and designating existing facilities for use for preferential parking for carpools’ and inserting ‘designating existing facilities for use for preferential parking for carpools, and real-time ridesharing projects, such as projects where drivers, using an electronic transfer of funds, recover costs directly associated with the trip provided through the use of location technology to quantify those direct costs, subject to the condition that the cost recovered does not exceed the cost of the trip provided’.

        <h3>Below is a list of some of the important things we do and don’t do.</h3>
        <h3>What we do:</h3>

          <li>We provide a means through which Users can make payments to each other in connection with their rides.

The prices for such rides are negotiated directly and solely by and between the Users. We may provide information regarding suggested pricing for rides or typical fares charged for similar rides.</li>

We also make no assurances regarding the timing, duration, quality or safety of the rides.</li>
          <li>We do not verify or in any way express an opinion with respect to the truth or accuracy of information provided by Users in their User Profiles. It is up to you and you alone to evaluate and determine whether you want to share a ride with one or more other Users.</li>
          <li>We do not express any opinion, nor do we make any assurances regarding, the truth or accuracy of any User reviews or ratings.</li>
